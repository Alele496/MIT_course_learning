1.What is the IPC for the two-stage pipelined processor for each benchmark tested by the run_bmarks.sh script?
    Answer: IPC = insts / cycles.   About 0.5.

2.What is the formula to compute the next address predictor accuracy from the IPC? 
(Hint, how many cycles does it take to execute an instruction when the PC+4 prediction is correct? 
What about when it is incorrect?) Using this formula, what is the accuracy of the PC+4 next address predictor for each benchmark?
    Answer: IPC = 0.5, but waste 0.5 cycle.

3.What is the IPC for the two-stage pipelined processor with a BTB for each benchmark tested by the run_bmarks.sh script? 
How much has it improved over the previous version?
    Answer: No specific testing was conducted, approximately 0 to 0.5.

4.How does adding the BTB change the performance of the bpred_* microbenchmarks? (Hint: the number of cycles for bpred_j should go down.)
    Answer:
