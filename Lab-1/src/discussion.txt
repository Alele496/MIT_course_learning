Write your answers to these questions in the text file discussion.txt provided with the initial lab code.



1.How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
    Answers: 
            Four doors are used, one NOT door, one OR door and two AND doors.
            Sixteen doors are used, one NOT door, five OR door and ten AND doors.
            total = 1(NOT door) + 1 * n(OR door) + 2 * n(AND door: two numbers to compare )

2.Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
    Answers: 
            Ripple carry adder(RCA): 8 * 5 = 40
            Carry select adder(CSA): 4 * 5 + 2 * 4 * 5 + 16(5 bits multiplexer) = 76

3.Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
    Answers:
            Ripple carry adder(RCA): 8 * A
            Carry select adder(CSA): 4 * A + M

4.Optional: How long did you take to work on this lab?
    Answers:
            It took about two hours, and it took me a lot of time to find the information and see the specific implementation code.
